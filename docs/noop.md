# from README.md to web3 financial services json 

This is a simplified representation, but it captures the key structure:

The top-level key is the main heading ("financial services in the web3 industry").
Subheadings become nested objects under the main key.
Information within subheadings is stored either as plain text or as an array of objects for lists (e.g., list of crypto exchanges).



// Example usage
parseTextIntoSections('../README.md')
  .then(sections => console.log(sections))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
